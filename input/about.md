Title: About Me
---

Hi, my name is Andreas Gr√ºnwald.

I'm a software developer currently working for Siemens.
I would call myself a ".NET enthusiast" and have been working on some
side projects in my spare time.
When I find time, I plan to write about my side projects here in this blog,
hoping others can benefit from it.

If you would like to comment on one of my posts, feel free to write me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ap0llo) or check out the my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/ap0llo).
